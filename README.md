# Zellaude

A Zellij status bar plugin that replaces the default tab bar with Claude Code activity awareness.

![Zellaude status bar example](assets/bar-example.svg)

> **This is a fork of [`ishefi/zellaude`](https://github.com/ishefi/zellaude) that adds one opt-in feature: "Tab titles".** This fork ships a prebuilt binary you can use today (see [Install](#install)). Everything else below is upstream's feature set, unchanged.

## What this fork adds

**Tab titles** (opt-in, default off). When enabled from the settings menu, each Claude tab is renamed to its pane's `PaneInfo.title`, the OSC title the program in that pane sets. Paired with a Claude Code hook that emits a short OSC title per task, this gives iTerm-style content-based tab labels. The setting persists to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`.

Gotcha: never run `rename-pane` on these panes. Zellij then stops honouring their OSC titles and tab-title sync silently stops working.

## Features

- **Full tab bar** — shows all Zellij tabs (not just Claude sessions), replacing the native tab bar
- **Session & mode display** — shows the Zellij session name and current input mode (NORMAL, LOCKED, PANE, etc.) with color-coded indicators
- **Live activity indicators** — see what every Claude Code session is doing at a glance; non-Claude tabs shown dimly
- **Clickable tabs** — click any tab to switch to it
- **Smart pane focus** — clicking a waiting (⚠) session focuses the exact pane so you can respond to the permission prompt immediately
- **Permission flash** — sessions pulse bright yellow for 2 seconds when a permission request arrives
- **Desktop notifications** — macOS notification on permission requests (rate-limited to once per 10s per tab), with click-to-focus support via [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier)
- **Elapsed time** — shows how long a session has been in its current state (after 30s), making it easy to spot stuck sessions
- **Multi-instance sync** — all Zellij tabs show a unified view of all sessions

### Activity symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $\color{#b4afc3}{◆}$ | Session starting |
| $\color{#b48cff}{●}$ | Thinking |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{⚡}$ | Running Bash |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{◉}$ | Reading / searching files |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{✎}$ | Editing / writing files |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{⊜}$ | Spawning subagent |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{◈}$ | Web search / fetch |
| $\color{#ffaa32}{⚙}$ | Other tool |
| $\color{#50c878}{▶}$ | Waiting for user prompt |
| $\color{#ff3c3c}{⚠}$ | Waiting for permission |
| $\color{#50c878}{✓}$ | Done |
| $\color{#b4afc3}{○}$ | Idle |

### Settings

Click the **Zellaude** prefix on the left side of the bar to open the settings menu. Click it again (or the `×` button) to close. Settings are persisted to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`.

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Notifications | Always / Unfocused / Off | Always | Desktop notifications on permission requests. "Unfocused" only notifies when the requesting pane is on a different tab. |
| Flash | Persist / Brief / Off | Brief | Yellow flash on permission requests. "Persist" keeps flashing until resolved, "Brief" flashes for 2 seconds. |
| Elapsed time | On / Off | On | Show time since last activity (appears after 30s). |
| Mode indicator | On / Off | On | Show the current Zellij input mode pill in the prefix. |
| Tab titles | On / Off | Off | Name each Claude tab after its pane's title (the OSC title the program in that pane sets). Zellaude only mirrors the pane title onto the tab; supply a meaningful title yourself, e.g. a Claude Code hook that emits an OSC title from the prompt. |

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — used by the hook script at runtime

### Quick install

Add the plugin to your Zellij layout — that's it:

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="https://github.com/rebelthor/zellaude/releases/latest/download/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

On first load, the plugin automatically installs the hook script and registers it with Claude Code. No cloning, no install scripts.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (in addition to the above)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebelthor/zellaude.git
cd zellaude
./install.sh
```

This builds the WASM plugin and copies it to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/`. Hook registration happens automatically when the plugin loads.

Then add the plugin to your Zellij layout (replaces the default tab bar):

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

Or try the included layout directly:

```bash
zellij --layout layout.kdl
```

### Optional: click-to-focus notifications

For desktop notifications that focus the right pane when clicked, install [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier):

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Without it, notifications still appear via osascript but clicking them won't focus the pane.

## Uninstall

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

## How it works

Two components:

1. **WASM plugin** — runs inside Zellij, receives events, maintains state in memory, renders the status bar, sends desktop notifications. On first load, writes the hook script to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
2. **Hook script** — a thin bash bridge that forwards Claude Code hook events to the plugin via `zellij pipe`

```
Claude Code hook → zellaude-hook.sh → zellij pipe → plugin → render
```

The hook script and registration are version-tagged and updated automatically when the plugin version changes.

All state lives in WASM memory. No temp files, no race conditions. Multiple plugin instances (one per tab) sync state automatically via inter-plugin messaging. Sessions are cleaned up automatically when tabs are closed.
